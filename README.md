# Protein-Processing
This project orients data for screening proteins from mass spectrometry results, specifically tailored to meet graduate students' needs. I filtered proteins from large mass dataset Excel files based on total peptide count and coverage using Python and the pandas library. The project automates the extraction, cleaning, and analysis of proteomic data to ensure efficient and accurate identification of significant proteins. Key functionalities include data normalization, integration, and visualization to support comprehensive protein interaction studies. I have provided detailed documentation and example scripts to facilitate easy adoption and customization. This repository streamlines the workflow for researchers working on protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions.
