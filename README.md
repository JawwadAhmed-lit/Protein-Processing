# Protein-Processing: Mass Spectrometry Protein Screening

**Protein-Processing** is a Python-based data processing tool designed to filter and analyze proteins from mass spectrometry datasets. Tailored for the needs of graduate students and researchers, this tool automates the workflow for extracting, cleaning, and analyzing proteomic data. It ensures efficient identification of significant proteins by filtering based on peptide count and coverage, helping in protein-protein and RNA-protein interaction studies.

## Features

- **Data Filtering**: Filters proteins from large datasets based on total peptide count and coverage.
- **Automation**: Streamlines the extraction and cleaning of mass spectrometry results.
- **Data Normalization**: Ensures that the data is standardized for further analysis.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual insights into proteomic data through graphs and plots.
- **Integration**: Easy integration with other tools for comprehensive protein interaction studies.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Data Extraction**: Automates the extraction of raw proteomic data from Excel files.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Uses filtering techniques to clean and remove redundant or irrelevant protein entries.
3. **Peptide Count and Coverage Filtering**: Filters proteins based on user-defined thresholds for total peptide count and coverage.
4. **Normalization**: Implements data normalization strategies to ensure accuracy and consistency across datasets.
5. **Visualization**: Generates graphs and plots for a visual understanding of protein interactions.
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation and example scripts to facilitate easy adoption and customization by researchers.
